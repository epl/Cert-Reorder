Cert-Reorder
============

A python script to re-order the certificates in a PEM formatted file. One of the applications we run requires that the certificates be in a particular order
(server, intermediate, CA) that conforms to [RFC5246](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5246#section-7.4.2) and our CA provided the certificates in the opposite
order (CA, intermediate, server) so I wrote this script to correct the ordering.

While the ultimate goal would be to have the ability to list the certificates in an arbitrary order, this currently is not supported. Adding that functionality
would be trivial. I had a perl script which would do just that, but for this specific use case that I wrote the script to solve, the input certificates were
always in CA, intermediate, server certificate irder and I needed them in the opposite order so I initially implemented a reversing operation `-r` and then
later also  implemented an automatic option `-a`

### Contributions

This script is licensed under fairly liberal terms, so please feel free to use it and hopefully make your life easier.  If you do find bugs, want to contribute
new features, etc please fork it, make the change, and make a pull request. For simple changes, you can also e-mail me either a diff or a complete script if it
isn't too big.

### Splunk Compatability

This script utilizes PyOpenSSL; the python bundled with Splunk includes this library, so it should be easy fairly easy to run.  By default the script utilizes
the standard python shebang line `#!/usr/bin/env python` which should invoke the systems version of python. It also includes an example on the third line of
directly utilizing the python bundled with Splunk (assuming `$SPLUNKHOME` is `/opt/splunk`) `#!/opt/splunk/bin/splunk cmd python` If you replace the first line
with this, (assuming you modify `/opt/splunk` to point to your `$SPLUNKHOME`) then it should work.

## Usage

To reverse the certificate order in the PEM file:

```sh
./cert-reorder.py -r certificatechain.pem
```

To analyze the certificates and put them in server, intermediate, CA order:

```sh
./cert-reorder.py -a certificatechain.pem
```

If you want to analyze the certificates and put them in CA, intermediate, server order you can use two invocations:

```sh
./cert-reorder.py -a certificatechain.pem | ./cert-reorder.py -r
```

If you want to verify the order of a certificate chain, you can use the -p option:

```sh
./cert-reorder.py -p certificatechain.pem
```

If you want to verify the order of the certificates after a command, you can save the results in a file and then use the previous command to print the common
names of the certificates or you can just run the command and pipe the output back to cert-reorder.py

```sh
./cert-reorder.py -a certificatechain.pem | ./cert-reorder.py -p
```

$ ./cert-reorder.py -h
